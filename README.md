Hello there! This is my first github repo. I hope my code isn't too bad. However, feel free to leave some feedback for improving the code.

Todo list console based application. Todo's save to a seperate file for later use.

Commands:

stop / exit     | exits the console and saves todo list

add (todo)      | adds a todo

remove (todo)   | removes a todo

done (todo)     | check off a todo

undone (todo)   | uncheck a todo

show            | shows todo list



The above also shows whenever you type 'help' in the console when running main.
